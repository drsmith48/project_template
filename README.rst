A Python project template with docs, CI, code coverage, versioning, and testing.

The structure of this project began from a ``cookiecutter`` template::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

The ``cookiecutter`` template provided support for tox, Travis-CI, Makefile, pytest, sphinx documentation, and setup.py.  Support for bumpversion, coverage.py, and codecov.io was added.

* Sphinx and Read the Docs for documentation
* Tox and Travis-CI for continuous integration
* coverage.py and codecov.io for code coverage
* pytest and nose for testing
* pylint, pep8, and codeclimate.com for code quality
* dependencies with pyup.io
* badges
* versioning with bumpversion

Python Boilerplate contains all the boilerplate you need to create a Python package.
